# Android Etalon - DaCapo
Etalon-DaCapo is a port of a set of [DaCapo Java Benchmark ](http://www.dacapobench.org/) to Android devices.
Since some Java libraries are not fully supported on Android and some others packages are completely left out, we ported only four applications:

		1. lusearch
		2. xalan
		3. pmd
		4. hsqldb (sqlite)

The port is intended to be generic, and configurable to serve as a tool for Mobile benchmarking by the system developers.
