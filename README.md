# Android Etalon - DaCapo
Etalon-DaCapo is a port of a set of [DaCapo Java Benchmark ](http://www.dacapobench.org/) to Android devices.
Since some Java libraries are not fully supported on Android and some others packages are completely left out, we ported only four applications:

		1. lusearch
		2. xalan
		3. pmd
		4. hsqldb (sqlite)

The port is intended to be generic, and configurable to serve as a tool for Mobile benchmarking by the system developers.

## How this is useful?
Unlike all the other mobile benchmarks, this benchmark suite focuses on high level performance of the runtime (Virtual Machine).
The ability to execute deterministic workload without environmental effect (GPS, WiFI, etc..) allows the system developers to analyse the main system performance.

### Running
From command line execute: 

~~~shell
./runapp.sh
~~~

The script takes care of copying the data folder to the external storage of the device as well as installing the apk file.
